example of public administration and actively promoting it with the ZeJN (Public Procurement Act); o systematic updating of school and study programmes to improve knowledge relevant for the transition to climate-neutral and circular economy; o to train, within the educational process, staff who will have the relevant skills needed to move to a climate-neutral society, with an emphasis on technical
